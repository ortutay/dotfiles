        <p>Hideho everybody.</p>

<p>Thomas, Erin, and I are pleased to bring you Stockfighter, a series of free, fun programming challenges.  They're suitable for programmers at all experience levels.</p>

<p>Stockfighter has two tech trees, each a series of levels linked in the game narrative which get progressively deeper and deeper into the technical underbelly of a simulated Wall Street not too unlike our own.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Trades.Exec()</strong>: Show off your systems programming chops by programming against our <a href="https://starfighter.readme.io">stock exchange's API</a>.  We assume no prior experience with automated trading and teach you everything you need to know as you go along.  You can play with any tech stack which speaks HTTP, or try doing everything by hand (or curl) if you like playing life on hard mode.  Representative challenges include "Make money as a participant in the market executing on an automated trading strategy" through stuff which is a little more... out there.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jailbreak</strong>: We give you a simulated <a href="http://sockpuppet.org/issue-79-file-0xb-foxport-hht-hacking.txt.html">VKSI2000 Hand-Held Trading Device</a>, running on three AVR microprocessors.  You get to donk around with the internals of this device and, through it, the internals of the stock exchange which (unwisely) believes this device to be hack-proof.  We have a series of challenges built up for Jailbreak, but prior to releasing them we're going to give players a few weeks to get used to the programming environment.  Think of it as sort of like a Tamagochi... which you can root... which can talk to every other Tamagochi in the world... while speaking the TCP/IP of money.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>What Does This Cost?</h2>

<p>Stockfighter is, and always will be, totally free to players.  Have fun! </p>

<p>We have infinite amounts of Fake Internet Money, and you're always a click on Reset Level away from undoing anything which happened.  There is absolutely no risk to playing the game.  (Some of our players find it a fun excuse to learn new languages or try out things they wouldn't get to otherwise.)</p>

<h2>How Much Time Do These Take?</h2>

<p>Our earliest levels are total gimmies if you've ever programmed before.  The middle levels are designed to take roughly ~45 minutes on average.  Our hardest levels are designed to be a fun evening or weekend project for a professional programmer.</p>

<p>You can play whenever you want, at any pace which works for you.  Some players will race to complete these.  Some will play leisurely.  Either is perfectly fine.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>Stockfighter will receive regular content updates.  This first release is Chapter 1.  We intend to release a new chapter approximately every 6 to 8 weeks.  Each will have about as many levels as Chapter 1 does.  </p>

<h2>Why Are You Doing This?</h2>

<p>The three of us really enjoy programming challenges / CTFs / games.  The most fun ones we've played disappear from the Internet after a few weeks because keeping them up and running is an operational nightmare.  </p>

<p>We decided to found a company to do nothing other than create and operate the best programming challenges in the world.  Why?  Partly because it's an excuse to do fun, hard programming, like building a stock exchange for the heck of it.  Partly it fulfills childhood dreams of running a video game company.  But mostly because we think we can fix the ways engineers get jobs.</p>

<h2>How On Earth Do You Make Money?</h2>

<p>We're contingency recruiters who believe that <a href="http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/">the way this industry hires engineers is broken</a>.  We're here to fix it.  </p>

<p>A small portion of our players, at any given time, are looking for their next job.  We have arrangements with a small number of great tech companies -- such as Stripe, Twilio, Shopify, Zenefits, Pebble, Twitch, and others -- where we keep our eyes open for great engineers.  </p>

<p>Stockfighter lets us automatically and manually identify really talented engineers.  We may occasionally reach out to some of them and ask to talk, geek-to-geek, about their experience with the game and about career goals.</p>

<p>If they have any interest in getting a new job, we introduce them to one appropriate to their goals and then put them in touch directly with the person hiring for it.  Our clients pay us when we send them engineers who subsequently accept a job offer.</p>

<p>If you aren't looking for a job, no worries!  We expect that on the order of 95% or so of our players at any given time are just here for the fun of it.  We are <em>all about</em> the fun of it.</p>

<p>We'll never pass on your information to any company unless you ask us to.  By default the system doesn't expose any information about you publicly, but if you want a page to brag about your achievements or to see yourself on our leaderboards, you can turn that on.  (Here's <a href="https://www.stockfighter.io/ui/profile/patio11">my profile</a>, which is set to Show Everything Publicly.)</p>

<h2>How Do I Get Started?</h2>

<p>Great question!  You can just go to <a href="https://www.stockfighter.io">https://www.stockfighter.io</a> and dive in if you'd like.  We're <a href="http://www.starfighters.io/about.html">super accessible</a> on the Internets if you have questions.  You can also ask them here (after you've created a Stockfighter account).</p>

<p>If you'd prefer to read a little bit about our programming environment first, you can read the <a href="https://starfighter.readme.io">API docs for the trading levels</a> or an in-universe <a href="http://sockpuppet.org/issue-79-file-0xb-foxport-hht-hacking.txt.html">writeup of our handheld trading device</a>.</p>

<h2>Anything Else?</h2>

<p>We have the <a href="https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/the-zeroth-rule">Zeroth Rule</a>.  Please abide by it, so that the games stay Fun for everyone.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://starfighter.readme.io/docs/what-is-stockfighter-faq">FAQ</a> answers many frequently asked questions.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/users/patio11">@patio11</a></p>

<p>While you and the team work hard on getting the servers back up, I wanted to take a moment and say "<strong>Thank you</strong>" for starting this!</p>

<p>I'm sure I'm not alone in showing our appreciation and look forward to enjoying the games.</p>

<p>This makes me nostalgic: my first online challenge started with an obscure game called the CyberArmy Zebulun Challenge.</p>

<p>It was good fun (although a little easy) and I have been hooked ever since. Funnily enough, while I have programmed for x68, 8051 and PIC16 assembly, I have not read the AVR RISC set, so this is going to be interesting <img src="https://cdn-standard.discourse.org/images/emoji/emoji_one/slightly_smiling.png?v=1" title=":slightly_smiling:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling:"></p>

<p>Thanks again and all the best!</p>

They're suitable for programmers at all experience levels.<\/p>\n\n<p>Stockfighter has two tech trees, each a series of levels linked in the game narrative which get progressively deeper and deeper into the technical underbelly of a simulated Wall Street not too unlike our own.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Trades.Exec()<\/strong>: Show off your systems programming chops by programming against our <a href=\"https://starfighter.readme.io\">stock exchange's API<\/a>.  We assume no prior experience with automated trading and teach you everything you need to know as you go along.  You can play with any tech stack which speaks HTTP, or try doing everything by hand (or curl) if you like playing life on hard mode.  Representative challenges include \"Make money as a participant in the market executing on an automated trading strategy\" through stuff which is a little more... out there.  <\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Jailbreak<\/strong>: We give you a simulated <a href=\"http://sockpuppet.org/issue-79-file-0xb-foxport-hht-hacking.txt.html\">VKSI2000 Hand-Held Trading Device<\/a>, running on three AVR microprocessors.  You get to donk around with the internals of this device and, through it, the internals of the stock exchange which (unwisely) believes this device to be hack-proof.  We have a series of challenges built up for Jailbreak, but prior to releasing them we're going to give players a few weeks to get used to the programming environment.  Think of it as sort of like a Tamagochi... which you can root... which can talk to every other Tamagochi in the world... while speaking the TCP/IP of money.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<h2>What Does This Cost?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Stockfighter is, and always will be, totally free to players.  Have fun! <\/p>\n\n<p>We have infinite amounts of Fake Internet Money, and you're always a click on Reset Level away from undoing anything which happened.  There is absolutely no risk to playing the game.  (Some of our players find it a fun excuse to learn new languages or try out things they wouldn't get to otherwise.)<\/p>\n\n<h2>How Much Time Do These Take?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Our earliest levels are total gimmies if you've ever programmed before.  The middle levels are designed to take roughly ~45 minutes on average.  Our hardest levels are designed to be a fun evening or weekend project for a professional programmer.<\/p>\n\n<p>You can play whenever you want, at any pace which works for you.  Some players will race to complete these.  Some will play leisurely.  Either is perfectly fine.<\/p>\n\n<h2>What's Next?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Stockfighter will receive regular content updates.  This first release is Chapter 1.  We intend to release a new chapter approximately every 6 to 8 weeks.  Each will have about as many levels as Chapter 1 does.  <\/p>\n\n<h2>Why Are You Doing This?<\/h2>\n\n<p>The three of us really enjoy programming challenges / CTFs / games.  The most fun ones we've played disappear from the Internet after a few weeks because keeping them up and running is an operational nightmare.  <\/p>\n\n<p>We decided to found a company to do nothing other than create and operate the best programming challenges in the world.  Why?  Partly because it's an excuse to do fun, hard programming, like building a stock exchange for the heck of it.  Partly it fulfills childhood dreams of running a video game company.  But mostly because we think we can fix the ways engineers get jobs.<\/p>\n\n<h2>How On Earth Do You Make Money?<\/h2>\n\n<p>We're contingency recruiters who believe that <a href=\"http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/\">the way this industry hires engineers is broken<\/a>.  We're here to fix it.  <\/p>\n\n<p>A small portion of our players, at any given time, are looking for their next job.  We have arrangements with a small number of great tech companies -- such as Stripe, Twilio, Shopify, Zenefits, Pebble, Twitch, and others -- where we keep our eyes open for great engineers.  <\/p>\n\n<p>Stockfighter lets us automatically and manually identify really talented engineers.  We may occasionally reach out to some of them and ask to talk, geek-to-geek, about their experience with the game and about career goals.<\/p>\n\n<p>If they have any interest in getting a new job, we introduce them to one appropriate to their goals and then put them in touch directly with the person hiring for it.  Our clients pay us when we send them engineers who subsequently accept a job offer.<\/p>\n\n<p>If you aren't looking for a job, no worries!  We expect that on the order of 95% or so of our players at any given time are just here for the fun of it.  We are <em>all about<\/em> the fun of it.<\/p>\n\n<p>We'll never pass on your information to any company unless you ask us to.  By default the system doesn't expose any information about you publicly, but if you want a page to brag about your achievements or to see yourself on our leaderboards, you can turn that on.  (Here's <a href=\"https://www.stockfighter.io/ui/profile/patio11\">my profile<\/a>, which is set to Show Everything Publicly.)<\/p>\n\n<h2>How Do I Get Started?<\/h2>\n\n<p>Great question!  You can just go to <a href=\"https://www.stockfighter.io\">https://www.stockfighter.io<\/a> and dive in if you'd like.  We're <a href=\"http://www.starfighters.io/about.html\">super accessible<\/a> on the Internets if you have questions.
